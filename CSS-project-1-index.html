					<h3>This article will be a comparison article on two of the greatest, and most popular types of engines. The first engine is the Piston engine. This engine is very common and is in most cars you will see on the road. Some of these cars include; the Ferrari F136, the Ford Coyote, the Chrysler Magnum, the Chrysler Hellcat and many more cars that you might see everyday, or not once in your life. A piston engine is an internal combustion engine that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert pressure into a rotational motion. The second of the two engines is the rotary engine. Although much less comon and reliadle, the rotary engine is a beast that can produce some of the best sounding cars to date. A few of the cars that are equipped with this engine are; the Audi A1 e-tron concept, the Citroen GS Birotor, and two of the most famouse japanese legends, the Mazda rx-7 and rx-8. A rotary engine has an oval shaped casing and inside is a triangular shape which goes through a cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occurs each revolution of the rotor.</h3>

								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Functionality:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">A piston engine is a traditional automotive engine that uses reciprocating pistons to create a rotating motion. The pistons are connected to a cylinder where gas and air is burned. When the mixture of gas and air burns, it creates pressure that pushes the respective piston, thus rotating the crankshaft and moving the vehicle.</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Rarity:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">Piston engines are by far the most common type of automotive engine and they are even used in many airplanes. Nearly all major automakers use piston engines in some or all of their vehicles. If you look around on the road almost all cars are piston engines.	</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Reliability:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">The piston engine is for sure a reliable engine, but the fact that there are so many moving parts in the engine means there is a higher likelyhood of the engine having a mechanical breakdown.</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Fuel Efficiency:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">The fuel efficiency of piston engines are another great thing about them. Having a strong fuel efficiency is an awesome trait to have when the gass prices are this high. You can also travel further in a piston engine car than a rotary.</h4>
								<br />
							</td>
							
							
							<td width="50%">
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Functionality:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">Also known as a wankel engine, a rotary engine uses an odd number of cylinders in a radial layout. They are generally smaller, lighter and more compact than their piston engine counterparts. They are called "rotary engines" because all their parts rotate. In comparison, piston engines have reciprocating pistons that move up and down in the cylinders.</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Rarity:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">As a high contrast to piston engines, rotary engines are very rare to find on the road. This is because there are a few very important shortcomings to the engine. Ther most common place to find a rotary engine is in a few of Mazda's cars.</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Reliability:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">Reliability is the one thing that the rotary engine does quite well. Since there are less moving parts inside the engine, there is a lower chance of the engine breaking dorn for mechanical reasons.</h4>
								<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								<h4 style="padding-left: 2%;">Fuel Efficiency:</h4>
								<h4 style="padding-left: 1%; padding-right: 1%;">Another thing that leads the rotary engine to the bottom of this comparison is its poor fuel efficiency. The rotary engine will burn fuel like nothing you have ever seen and in many cases you will have to refill the oil as well.</h4>

			<div id="div-1">
			<h3>Overall there are a lot of differences between these two engines. The piston engine is superior because of its awesome fuel efficiency which allows you to get places with less stops, and its functionality which makes it very easy to modify and push out a lot of horsepower easily. Another thing that it excells at is the fact that it is very easy to get these engines because they are some of the most popular on the market. Some of the things that the rotary engine excells at are one, its reliability. This engine has less chance of breaking down because it has less moving parts. This engine is also good at making really cool sounds so thats nice. Overall the rotary engine is better for reliability and good sounds and the piston engine is better at fuel efficiency and functionality.</h3>
